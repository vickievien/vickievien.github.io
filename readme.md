# Tech Used
Used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some Illustrator and Photoshop for logo editing.

# Approach
Mobile-first approach.
For each page: 
- wireframe mobile, then wireframe tablet, then wireframe laptop.

My first round, I created separate html docs and stylesheets for each nav link:
- Created a main.css to house all nav, footer and any global styles.
- Then created invidividual stylesheets for each separate page

My second round: A UX friend said it looked too bare on each page, and expected to scroll, so then I combined Home, Portfolio and Skills into the Home Page. Then Bio and Contact was it's own separate page:
- Originally I had my hero, portfolio and skills all separate pages. After a friend in UX looked at it, it made more sense to combine it into one, so had to re-work and consolidate. But I still kept bio and contact as separate pages. Then another UX friend said keep it consistent, either all separate, or all together. So together it is.

My third round: Another UX friend said that if I choose parallax scrolling, it should all be parallax or if I choose to do separate pages, all should be separate pages, so then I decided to consolidate and make everything into one page for parallax scrolling. I still kept my main.css style separate for header/footer in case in the event I do choose to separate out the pages down the road.


One thing to note: I created a resume page per project requirements to show work experience. But I chose not to spend as much time on styling with CSS, as I do not plan to have this in my portfolio in the future. I have a link that downloads my resume into a PDF should a recruiter be interested in my resume in the contact section. In place of spending time on styling the resume, I chose to put my time and effort in creating a second project to call a cocktail API.
