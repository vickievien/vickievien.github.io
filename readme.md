# Tech Used
Used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some Illustrator and Photoshop for logo editing.

# Approach
Mobile-first approach.
For each page: 
- wireframe mobile, then wireframe tablet, then wireframe laptop

Created a main.css to house all nav, footer and any global styles.
Then created invidividual stylesheets for each separate page

Originally I had my hero, portfolio and skills all separate pages. After a friend in UX looked at it, it made more sense to combine it into one, so had to re-work and consolidate. But I still kept bio and contact as separate pages.
